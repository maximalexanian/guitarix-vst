// Yet another tube preamp experiment
// So far so good :
// Bright bypass must not do fi.zero division
// Look at actual gain of tube stages in real preamp
// and maybe adjust stage1 outpu to reflect as at present with gain at 0dB get very
// little distortion/overload
// Also look at relative loss in tonestack  
// stage1 gain is 30dB-35dB in reality
// tonestack takes around 12dB off in central position
// So stage1 effectively should boost by 18-23dB but in effect does only 3dB
// So to accuratley model the overload of next stage would need a boost of around
// 15-20dB at this point x 5.6 -> x10
// Would then need to attenuate final output to compensate ( actual preamp has 60dB gain! )

//  Based on simple Alembic F-2B vstudio preamp
//  2 sections of 12AX7 together with tonestack and volume
// This is an identical circuit apart from coupling caps whcih could do with filters
// 1st cathode cap gives aroudn 2Hz !
// Coupling cap sat end gives cutoff 1.6Hz!
// So only reason to do is to eliminate low frequency rubbish
