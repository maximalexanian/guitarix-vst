To generate documentation please start doxygen in this directory.
There is only sparse documentation in the sources, so you will get
mostly structural information generated by doxygen.

The contents of the directory "preprocessed" are generated from the
*.mdx files with the script ../tools/undiag. If you want to change
.mdx files (and regenerated the documentation) you need those tools
(preprocessing + doxygen: script ../tools/build-documentation).

Change the setting of HAVE_DOT to NO in Doxyfile if you don't have
graphviz installed (or if you don't need the pretty graphs and want to
accelerate the doxygen pass).

To view the generated documentaion, use a browser on html/index.html.
